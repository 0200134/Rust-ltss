# ♻️ Rust-LTSS — Sustainability Manifesto
> “From safety to independence — Sustaining Rust beyond LLVM.”

---

## 🧱 Purpose
Rust-LTSS aims to keep Rust *buildable, reproducible, and independent* for at least a decade —  
without relying on centralized registries, compilers, or toolchains.

This document defines how long-term sustainability is achieved and maintained across the ecosystem.

---

## 🌍 Long-Term Goals
| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🧩 **Independence** | Rust that can compile itself without mandatory LLVM or Cargo dependencies. |
| 🧱 **Reproducibility** | Every release must be rebuildable with deterministic outputs after 10+ years. |
| ⚙️ **Transparency** | Builds should be traceable through simple CMake + Git, no opaque layers. |
| 🧠 **Longevity** | Code, binaries, and manifests must remain compatible across decades. |
| 🌐 **Cross-compatibility** | Seamless interoperability with C/C++ and minimal tool dependencies. |

---

## 🔒 Reproducibility Policy
1. **Version-locked releases** — Each Rust-LTSS version pins compiler + dependency hashes.  
2. **Immutable manifests** — All TOML manifests archived under `/manifests/` for historical rebuilds.  
3. **CI timestamped logs** — GitHub Actions logs exported and signed per release.  
4. **Source mirrors** — Git-based mirrors stored on multiple hosts (`r3c-foundation`, `archive.org`, etc.).  
5. **No auto-update behavior** — Manual opt-in required for new dependencies.

---

## 🧩 Maintenance Strategy
| Layer | Responsibility | Cycle |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Core (`r3c`) | Self-hosting compiler backend | Yearly LTS audit |
| Rust-LTSS | Long-term Rust layer | 3-year review |
| Post-NASM | Backend evolution / assembler-free | 5-year review |
| Docs & Specs | Manifest, architecture, sustainability reports | Continuous |

---

## 🧠 Archive & Preservation
- All releases exported as `.tar.zst` archives and stored in `releases/archives/`.  
- Checksums (`.sha512sum`) attached to every binary.  
- `docs/manifest_history.md` records the entire lineage of reproducible builds.  
- Snapshots periodically mirrored to IPFS or decentralized storage.

## 🪶 Human Sustainability
Rust-LTSS encourages minimalism and clarity over velocity.  
Documentation, transparency, and mentorship outweigh release frequency.  
> “A slow ecosystem is a sustainable one.”

## 🧭 Timeline Alignment
| Year | Phase | Goal |
|------|--------|------|
| 2025–2027 | Planning & Documentation | Define reproducibility & sustainability policy |
| 2028 | Implementation Start | Integrate reproducible builds into R3C pipeline |
| 2029+ | Expansion | Embedded & Industrial LTS Rust |
