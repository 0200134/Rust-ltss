# 🦀 Rust-LTSS Documentation Guide

## 📘 Overview
**Rust-LTSS (Long-Term Sustain Support)** is a frozen Rust 1.70.0 environment maintained by the R3C Foundation.  
It guarantees **deterministic, reproducible, and LLVM-independent** builds for compiler research, embedded systems, and industrial use.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Ensure *toolchain immutability* (no automatic upgrades).
- Provide *build reproducibility* across OSes and time.
- Support *LLVM-Zero compatibility* for R3C compiler pipelines.
- Serve as a *long-term base layer* for cpppm and Beyond-LLVM projects.

## ⚙️ Toolchain Specification
| Component | Version | Purpose |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Rust | 1.70.0 | Frozen compiler baseline |
| Cargo | 1.70 default | Reproducible build manager |
| LLVM | Optional / frozen | Prevents upstream regressions |
| Platforms | Linux · macOS · Windows | Cross-platform reproducibility |

---

## 🧭 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r3c-foundation/rust-ltss.git
cd rust-ltss



Rust-LTSS automatically enforces the fixed toolchain via:


# rust-toolchain.toml
[toolchain]
channel = "1.70.0"
components = ["rust-src", "rustfmt", "clippy"]
profile = "minimal"



Verify:


rustc --version
# rustc 1.70.0 (90c541806 2023-05-31)



Build:


cargo build --release



Artifacts appear under target/ltss/.



🧱 LTSS Manifest


Each LTSS build includes a manifest file:


[ltss]
version = "1.70.0"
date = "2025-01-01"
hash = "sha256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
platforms = ["linux", "macos", "windows"]



This file ensures reproducibility and auditability of releases.



🔒 Integrity Verification


Each release contains:




SHA256SUMS.txt


Optional .asc signature




Verify locally:


sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt

Would you like me to add companion files in the same `docs/` folder (for example `LTSS_POLICY.md` and `LTSS_SECURITY.md`), so the documentation set looks like a real industrial LTSS package?
