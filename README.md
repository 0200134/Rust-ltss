# 🦀 Rust-LTSS — Long-Term Sustain System

> **“From safety to independence — Sustaining Rust beyond LLVM.”**

---

## 🌍 Overview
**Rust-LTSS (Long-Term Sustain System)** is a conceptual and future experimental branch of Rust,  
focusing on *stability, independence, and self-sustainability* beyond LLVM.

It extends the ideas of [R3C](https://github.com/0200134/r3c),  
bridging **C++ → Rust → ASM** for long-term reproducibility and cross-platform resilience.

> 📌 This repository is currently in a **placeholder state**.  
> **Active development is scheduled to begin in 2028.**

## ⚙️ Core Idea
Rust-LTSS explores how Rust can sustain itself for decades —  
independent of centralized registries, compilers, and toolchains.  

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🧩 **Independence** | Rust without mandatory LLVM or Cargo dependencies |
| 🧱 **Sustainability** | 10+ year reproducible builds |
| ⚡ **Cross-compatibility** | Full interoperability with C/C++ systems |
| 🧠 **Transparency** | Simple CMake + Git workflow philosophy |

## 🧩 Development Timeline

| Year | Phase | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| **2025–2027** | Planning & Documentation | 🧭 Concept design only |
| **2028** | 🚀 **Implementation Start** | *(Scheduled)* |
| **2029+** | Expansion to Embedded / Industrial | *(Future plan)* |

> 💤 Until 2028, this repository remains dormant as a **conceptual placeholder**.
