## 🧠 What is Rust-LTSS?

**Rust-LTSS (Long-Term Sustain System)** is a long-term evolution layer for the Rust ecosystem —  
a framework that ensures **stability, survivability, and sustainability** of Rust itself.  

It is not a fork of Rust.  
It is **Rust that survives time** — a *continuity layer* independent from short release cycles and external toolchains like LLVM.

> **Rust-LTSS = Rust that endures.**

---

## 🧭 Core Idea

Rust has mastered *safety* but not yet *longevity*.  
The official Rust release model prioritizes rapid iteration (6-week cadence).  
Rust-LTSS shifts that focus toward **temporal endurance**.

| Concept | Rust (Official) | Rust-LTSS |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Core Goal | Safety & Performance | **Longevity & Self-Reliance** |
| Release Model | 6-week incremental | 5-10 year sustain window |
| Compiler Dependency | LLVM + Cargo | LLVM-independent, self-bootstrapped |
| Focus | Innovation speed | Predictable stability |
| Ecosystem Priority | Rapid evolution | Industrial endurance |

---

## 🧩 Philosophy Keywords

- **Sustainability over Novelty** — Rust should not expire with time.  
- **Self-Hosting Independence** — The toolchain must survive without LLVM or Cargo.  
- **Compatibility before Experimentation** — Breaking changes destroy ecosystems.  
- **Transparency & Portability** — Every build must be understandable and reproducible.  
- **Time as a First-Class Citizen** — Code that lasts 10 years > code that runs 10× faster.

---

## 🏗️ Why LTSS?

Because software outlives its authors.  
Modern Rust evolves too fast for industrial, embedded, and government adoption.  
They require **predictable, certifiable, long-term stable Rust**.

> **LTSS = a promise:**  
> “Your Rust code, unchanged, will still compile in 2040.”

Rust-LTSS is not rebellion — it’s **preservation**.  
A bridge between Rust’s youth and its legacy.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Vision (2027 → 2030)

1. **Self-Bootstrapped Rust Frontend** — Built on stable C++/NASM pipeline.  
2. **Frozen ABI / API Surface** — Maintainable 5–10 years.  
3. **Cross-Platform CI-Safe Build** — Deterministic across Windows / Linux / macOS.  
4. **Spec-Driven Release System** — `ltss_spec.md` defines language + tool invariants.  
5. **Long-Term Archive Format** — Stable `.rlt` package with signed metadata.

---

## 🌍 Summary

> Rust was built to be **safe**.  
> LTSS is built to make it **last**.

The future of Rust is not in speed —  
it’s in **resilience**, **continuity**, and **industrial permanence**.  
LTSS is the codename for that survival instinct.

## 🕰️ Timeline

| Year | Stage | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **2025 – 2026** | Silent Foundation | Documentation, philosophy, CI skeleton |
| **2027** | Awakening | LTSS pre-launch / early spec publication |
| **2028** | Release 1.0 | Public spec + sustainable toolchain prototype |
| **2030 +** | Continuum | Long-term maintenance and LTS sustain cycles |

## ⚙️ License & Intent

This document is public and open for adaptation.  
Rust-LTSS is **not a replacement** for Rust —  
it is an **insurance policy** for Rust’s future longevity.
